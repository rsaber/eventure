## COMP4920 Project - Eventure ##
* by Claire (z5076501), Jess (z5076485), Sarah (z5059829) and Riyasat (z5084528)
* Please note the web application is optimised for modern versions of Chrome

## Getting Started: ##
* Install Maven, NodeJS and NPM, and setup database (see database section).
* Run `mvn springboot:run` in terminal in the root directory (same directory as this README).
* Alternatively, to run from the jar run `java -jar eventure-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
* When you see `Started Application in ... seconds`, the application is successfully running!
* Open http://localhost:8080/ and you should see 'Eventure'.

## Database ##
* Install MySQL, remember to add a password when prompted
* Run the sql script: `mysql -u root -p < eventure_data.sql`

## Frontend: ##
* To automatically update JavaScript on saves, run `npm run watch` in the background on commandline. Now when you make
changes, they should be reflected in the browser after a few seconds on a refresh of the page.
* To update the CSS, run `cp src/main/resources/static/main.css target/classes/static/main.css` each time.
